Wolfram API
===========

Wolfram API was originally intended only to be a raw API for accessing Wolfram|Alpha's XML data API. However, such a project would be and was boring to implement on its own, so I decided to have a little fun and implement a nice-looking Cocoa UI for it. As of now, running this project will present you with a usable user-interface, which will shortly incorporate all of Wolfram|Alpha's online features.
